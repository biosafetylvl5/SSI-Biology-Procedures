\section{Overview} % CHANGE THIS 
This lab will attempt to append \BdATP{} to a short (25bp) primer. The effectiveness of this attempt will be determined by attempting to form a homopolymer on the modified primer. If a homopolymer is formed, the blocking groups did not effectively prevent their formation. This could be due to many reasons (the most likely of which being that the blocking groups either (1) were appended without the 2' nitrobenzyl due to sample degradation or (2) were not appended). If the homopolymer was not formed (but a homopolymer was formed on the controls) it follows that the blocking groups prevented the formation of the homopolymer, likely due to them preforming their intended function.

\subsection{Analysis}
\subsubsection{Prepare Gel}
We will be preparing a 4\% Agarose Gel \cite{dnaAgarose}
\item{Add 3.2g of Agarose to 80mL of TBE Buffer}
\item{Mix well, and microwave until agarose is completely dissolved}
\item{Pour into gel apparatus and let cool}
\item{Add buffer to gel}
\subsubsection{Run Gel}
\item{Add 5\uL of samples A, B, C and X with 1\uL{} of loading dye for a total volume of 5\uL to gel respectively, left to right with the wells at the top.}
\item{Add a 50/50 combination of sample \textbf{B} and sample \textbf{C} to the sixth well. That is, add \textbf{3\uL{}} of sample \textbf{B}, \textbf{3\uL{}} of sample \textbf{B} and \textbf{1.2}\uL{} of loading dye to the sixth well, from the left with the wells at the top.}
\item{Run at 100V (at 1 hour, the voltage was changed to 130V due to time constraints)}
\item{Remove gel once the Xylene Cyanol FF has almost reached the $\frac{3}{4}$ point \cite{dnaAgarose}}

\subsubsection{Stain \& View Gel}
\item{While the gel runs, prepare 1X SYBR Gold Staining Solution with TBE as dilute}
\item{Once gel has finished running, \textbf{\textit{lightly}} agitate gel while submerged in solution for 15 minutes.}
\item{Review gel with gel viewer. Until unnecessary, place gel back in stain for 10 minute increments and re-image (this was done 4 time on the first run).}
\item{Post pictures to Slack.}\\
This procedure took 4.5 hours to run.
\end{enumerate}

\item{Label containers if not already labeled}
\item{Freeze samples at -20\C{}}

\section{Result Analysis}
\subsection{Summary}

\subsection{Gel Analysis}

\gel{./gels/blocked-annotated.png}{Overlay of two gels, the overnight stain and the 35minute overexposed stain}{Hybrid Gel}{This "gel" is a digital combination of the overnight and 35 minute stain. The gels were combined to reduce diffusion while increasing the visibility of our samples. The unmodified gels are pictured below in figure \ref{gels}. 


In the gel, from left to right, we have sample A (extended control with Adenine homopolymer to test geometric interactions), sample B (the "blocked" sample incubated with the 2'-nitrobenzyl modified adenine), sample C (a standard dNTP extended polymer formed in the second incubation) and sample X (just our 25bp primer) and a 50/50 mix of sample B and sample C. We also have a 10bp ladder from Thermo Fisher in the far right well \cite{10bpladder}.


Notably, sample B (marked with a dashed box) did not undergo marked extension after being incubated with \BdATP{}. There is some indication of slight extension (predicted due to \BdATP{} degradation). Moreover, the difference between sample A, sample B \textit{and} sample C further supports the conclusion that \BdATP{} was effectively incorporated by \tdt{} in standard conditions \textit{and} that \BdATP{} effectively prevents further incorporation of nucleotides.


However, given that there is only one sample (by the nature of this experiment) that exhibits this behavior, many other factor could have caused this behavior. Most notably, a human error that resulted in the omission of \tdt{} buffer, dATP, \tdt{} or nuclease free water would have produced visibly similar results. The fact that samples A and C both underwent successful extensions likely reduces (but does not eliminate) the apparent probability that human error is the source of the apparently promising results. Follow up experiments are necessary for confirmation and characterization.}

\caption{From left to right on the top row, we have 15, 25 and 35 minutes of stain with SYBR Gold all exposed for faint bands. On the bottom from left to right, we have a 2 second exposure of the gel after 35 minutes of stain, a faint bands exposure at 45 minutes of stain and finally a faint bands exposure of the gel after it was stained overnight. All staining was preformed with SYBR Gold.}

\subsection{Procedure Notes}
A 4\% gel was used, where a 2\% gel would have done just as fine. Further, the initial stain should have been 40 minutes, not 15.
