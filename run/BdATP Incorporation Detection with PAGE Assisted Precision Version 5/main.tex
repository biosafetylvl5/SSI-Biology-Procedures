\section{Procedure Purpose} % CHANGE THIS
Determine if the the modified nucleotide, \BdATP{}, can be noticeably incorporated by \tdt{} in "standard conditions" while determining the blocking efficacy \& purity of our \BdATP{} stock.

\section{Overview} % CHANGE THIS 
This lab will attempt to append \BdATP{} to a \textbf{short (25bp) primer}. The effectiveness of this attempt will be determined by attempting to form a homopolymer on the modified primer. If a homopolymer is formed, the blocking groups did not effectively prevent their formation. This could be due to many reasons (the most likely of which being that the blocking groups either (1) were appended without the 2' nitrobenzyl due to sample degradation or (2) were not appended). If the homopolymer was not formed (but a homopolymer was formed on the controls) it follows that the blocking groups prevented the formation of the homopolymer, likely due to them preforming their intended function. Moreover, all samples will be run on a PAGE gel in order to achieve single nucleotide resolution. This will allow us to confirm that the \BdATP{} is the only base appended to the "blocked" sample. A ddATP control will help as well.

\subsection{Analysis}
\subsection{XCell Surelock Setup and Pre-Run}
\item{Remove 20\% polyacrylamide gel from pouch and rinse with deionized water.}
\item{Peel off tape on bottom of 20\% polyacrylamide gel and remove the comb.}
\item{Gently wash every cassette well with 1X TBE buffer. Invert to remove buffer and shake. Repeat twice.}
\item{Lower the Buffer Core (the piece that holds the gels) into the Lower Buffer Chamber so that the negative electrode fits into the opening in the gold plate.}
\item{Insert the Gel Tension Wedge into the XCell Surelock behind the buffer core. Make sure it is in its 'unlocked' position, which allows the wedge to slip into the unit.}
\item{Insert gel cassettes into the lower buffer chamber. The shorter "well" side of the cassette faces into the buffer core. The slot on the back must face outward. If only one gel is being run, insert a buffer dam in the place of a gel cassette.}
\item{Pull forward on the Gel Tension Lever toward the buffer core until the gel cassettes are snug against the buffer core. This puts it in the 'locked' position.}
\item{Fill the Upper Buffer Chamber (between the gels) with running buffer. Ensure it is not leaking.}
\item{Fill the Lower Buffer Chamber completely with running buffer by pouring TBE next to the Gel Tension Wedge.}
\item{Pipette 12\uL{} of running buffer into each gel well.}
\item{Place the gel cover on the apparatus in the correct orientation. Connect the electrodes to the power source, and pre-run the gel for 30 minutes at 150V.}

\textbf{Note}: Be relatively swift about mixing and loading, as the samples will gradually begin to evaporate if left on the parafilm for too long.

\item{Obtain a sizable piece of parafilm. Pipette 5 \uL{} of Gel Loading Buffer in a row of 15 droplets.}
\item{For the 10/60 Ladder samples, pipette 1uL of 10/60 Ladder and 4 uL of running buffer and mix.}
\item{For the 'blank' droplets, pipette 5uL of running buffer.}
\item{For the remaining droplets, add 3.5 \uL{} of the appropriate sample along with 1.5\uL{} running buffer. See the corresponding table for sample location and order.}
\item{As you go, pipette up and down to mix thoroughly.}
\item{Load the gels (with 10 \uL{} sample in each well) when they are finished pre-running. Ensure pipette tip is fully in the well, and depress slowly and carefully. Work quickly to minimize diffusion.}
\item{If running a second gel, repeat steps 15-18, then pipette only 5uL of each sample into each well.}
\item{Run the gel(s) at 150V until the dark blue dye is at the bottom. If the dark blue dye is not visible, run the gel for three hours.}

\subsubsection{Stain \& View Gel}
\item{While the gel runs, prepare 1X SYBR Gold Staining Solution with TBE as dilute}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item{Add 6\uL{} SYBR Gold to 60\uL{} of TBE running buffer}
	\end{enumerate}
\item{Once gel has finished running, \textbf{\textit{lightly}} agitate gel while submerged in solution for 40 minutes.}
\item{Review gel with gel viewer. Until unnecessary, place gel back in stain for 20 minute increments and re-image.}
\item{Post pictures to Slack.}\\
