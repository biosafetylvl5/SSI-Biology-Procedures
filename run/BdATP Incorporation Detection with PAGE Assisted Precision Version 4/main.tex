\section{Procedure Purpose} % CHANGE THIS
Determine if the the modified nucleotide, \BdATP{}, can be noticeably incorporated by \tdt{} in "standard conditions" while determining the blocking efficacy \& purity of our \BdATP{} stock.

\section{Overview} % CHANGE THIS 
This lab will attempt to append \BdATP{} to a \textbf{short (25bp) primer}. The effectiveness of this attempt will be determined by attempting to form a homopolymer on the modified primer. If a homopolymer is formed, the blocking groups did not effectively prevent their formation. This could be due to many reasons (the most likely of which being that the blocking groups either (1) were appended without the 2' nitrobenzyl due to sample degradation or (2) were not appended). If the homopolymer was not formed (but a homopolymer was formed on the controls) it follows that the blocking groups prevented the formation of the homopolymer, likely due to them preforming their intended function. Moreover, all samples will be run on a PAGE gel in order to achieve single nucleotide resolution. This will allow us to confirm that the \BdATP{} is the only base appended to the "blocked" sample. A ddATP control will help as well.

\subsection{Analysis}
\subsection{XCell Surelock Setup and Pre-Run}
\item{Remove 20\% polyacrylamide gel from pouch and rinse with deionized water.}
\item{Peel off tape on bottom of 20\% polyacrylamide gel and remove the comb.}
\item{Gently wash every cassette well with 1X TBE buffer. Invert to remove buffer and shake. Repeat twice.}
\item{Lower the Buffer Core (the piece that holds the gels) into the Lower Buffer Chamber so that the negative electrode fits into the opening in the gold plate.}
\item{Insert the Gel Tension Wedge into the XCell Surelock behind the buffer core. Make sure it is in its 'unlocked' position, which allows the wedge to slip into the unit.}
\item{Insert gel cassettes into the lower buffer chamber. The shorter "well" side of the cassette faces into the buffer core. The slot on the back must face outward. If only one gel is being run, insert a buffer dam in the place of a gel cassette.}
\item{Pull forward on the Gel Tension Lever toward the buffer core until the gel cassettes are snug against the buffer core. This puts it in the 'locked' position.}
\item{Fill the Upper Buffer Chamber (between the gels) with running buffer. Ensure it is not leaking.}
\item{Fill the Lower Buffer Chamber completely with running buffer by pouring TBE next to the Gel Tension Wedge.}
\item{Pipette 12\uL{} of running buffer into each gel well.}
\item{Place the gel cover on the apparatus in the correct orientation. Connect the electrodes to the power source, and pre-run the gel for 30 minutes at 150V.}

\textbf{Note}: Be relatively swift about mixing and loading, as the samples will gradually begin to evaporate if left on the parafilm for too long.

\item{Obtain a sizable piece of parafilm. Pipette 5 \uL{} of Gel Loading Buffer in a row of 15 droplets.}
\item{For the 10/60 Ladder samples, pipette 1uL of 10/60 Ladder and 4 uL of running buffer and mix.}
\item{For the 'blank' droplets, pipette 5uL of running buffer.}
\item{For the remaining droplets, add 3.5 \uL{} of the appropriate sample along with 1.5\uL{} running buffer. See the corresponding table for sample location and order.}
\item{As you go, pipette up and down to mix thoroughly.}
\item{Load the gels (with 10 \uL{} sample in each well) when they are finished pre-running. Ensure pipette tip is fully in the well, and depress slowly and carefully. Work quickly to minimize diffusion.}
\item{If running a second gel, repeat steps 15-18, then pipette only 5uL of each sample into each well.}
\item{Run the gel(s) at 150V until the dark blue dye is at the bottom. If the dark blue dye is not visible, run the gel for three hours.}

\subsubsection{Stain \& View Gel}
\item{While the gel runs, prepare 1X SYBR Gold Staining Solution with TBE as dilute}
\item{Once gel has finished running, \textbf{\textit{lightly}} agitate gel while submerged in solution for 40 minutes.}
\item{Review gel with gel viewer. Until unnecessary, place gel back in stain for 20 minute increments and re-image.}
\item{Post pictures to Slack.}\\

\section{Result Analysis}
\subsection{Summary}
While our analytic techniques provided exemplary data, the data we did collect is in contradiction with our past results from the original \BdATP{} Incorporation Detection Experiment. Taken in isolation, this experiment suggests that the \BdATP{} \textit{does not} hinder extension (eg. does not block further extension or cannot be incorporated).
\subsection{Gel Analysis}

\label{endCondition}
\end{wrapfigure}


In the gel shown in Figure \ref{mainGel}, we have a variety of samples: from left to right, 10/60 Ladder, Custom Ladder, B (Blocked Sample), X (Unmodified Control), B+X, D (Blocked ddATP Control), B+X, A (dATP Extended Control), C (dNTP Extended Control), 10/60 Ladder, 26 mer, 25 mer, Custom Ladder, Custom Ladder and Blank. For easy reading, the order is also enumerated in figure \ref{tab:Gel Layout}.\\

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.2\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.18\textwidth]{./resources/midRun.jpg}
\caption{Our SDS PAGE gel mid run. Notice the absence of "upside down smiling".}
\label{noSmile}
\end{wrapfigure}

In direct contrast to our last two experiments \todo{Add reference here to our procedures}, the analysis PAGE gel of this experiment provided us with useful results with accurate single base pair resolution.
This is made evident by the three samples of Custom Ladder that were added to wells 2, 13 and 14. Moreover, the 26mer and 25mer were separated in adjacent wells similarly to the way the 26mer and the 25mer were separated as part of the Custom Ladder in the same well. This is important because it allows us to (1) compare multiple bands \textit{inside the same well} and (2) compare multiple bands \textit{across multiple wells}.\\
This is likely due to the lack of smiling and the long run time. See Figure \ref{noSmile} is a picture of our gel mid run (after about 40 minutes). Throughout it's run, the gel did not appear to have exceedingly different run rates for different gels.
Moreover, the gel was run for a total of three hours and 10 minutes. It was stopped once the loading dye reached the bottom of the gel, see Figure \ref{endCondition} for future reference.\\
However, while the analytical techniques were not the sour-note of this experiment, the results from this experiment provide a direct contradiction of our \BdATP{} Incorporation Detection experiment performed on September 28, 2017 (a month before this experiment was performed). Moreover, every control sample (with the exception of D+X) exhibited either (1) the same behavior as in the original \BdATP{} Incorporation Detection experiment or (2) alternate behavior that we predicted would result from switching from agarose to polyacrylamide for our gel electrophoresis medium. The discrepancy in question is the extension of Sample B. In the original \BdATP{} Incorporation Detection experiment, we \textit{did not} see extension of Sample B (see Figure \ref{oldGel}). In this experiment we \textit{did} see extension of Sample B. Moreover, there is little indication that the extension of Sample B by \tdt{} was in any way hampered by the presence of the \BdATP{} or the original \BdATP{} extension step.\\

The most likely explanation of this discrepancy is that either (1) we made an error while performing the experiment and/or that (2) this is some other discrepancy between this procedure and the original procedure that produced this anomaly. \todo{Discuss this anomaly and pour over the two procedures to identify discrepancies at the biology-terminator meeting}\\

Since we have conflicting results, this or, more likely, a modified version of this procedure will need to be run.

\subsection{Procedure Notes}
A few mistakes were made in this procedure:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{The wrong concentration of \tdt{} stock was used. This should have been avoided. The procedure made it clear enough, and the mistake was due solely to a lack of experience. This cause is \textbf{positive} when it comes to prevention as one will only grow more experienced, helping to ensure that the same mistake will not be made again for the same reasons.}
	\item{The 0.2\uL{}-2\uL{} micro pipette in the lab was not able to pipette 0.25\uL{} of \BdATP{} for the \BdATP{} dilute. The pipette was set to 0.5\uL{} and an estimated 0.2\uL{} to 0.75\uL{} of \BdATP{} stock was used in lieu of 0.25\uL{}. This will be fixed by either (1) changing the amount of \BdATP{} being utilized or (2) using the new 0.1\uL{}-1\uL{} pipette that SSI Biology recently acquired.}
