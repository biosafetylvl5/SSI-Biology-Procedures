\section{Procedure Purpose} % CHANGE THIS
Determine if the the modified nucleotide, \BdATP{}, can be noticeably incorporated by \tdt{} in "standard conditions" while determining the blocking efficacy \& purity of our \BdATP{} stock.

\section{Overview} % CHANGE THIS 
This lab will attempt to append \BdATP{} to a \textbf{very short (5bp) primer}. The effectiveness of this attempt will be determined by attempting to form a homopolymer on the modified primer. If a homopolymer is formed, the blocking groups did not effectively prevent their formation. This could be due to many reasons (the most likely of which being that the blocking groups either (1) were appended without the 2' nitrobenzyl due to sample degradation or (2) were not appended). If the homopolymer was not formed (but a homopolymer was formed on the controls) it follows that the blocking groups prevented the formation of the homopolymer, likely due to them preforming their intended function. Moreover, all samples will be run on a PAGE gel in order to achieve single nucleotide resolution. This will allow us to confirm that the \BdATP{} is the only base appended to the "blocked" sample. A ddATP control will help as well.

\subsubsection{Prepare Gel}
\item{Prepare a 15\% Denaturing Urea-PAGE gel.}\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Do not invert the gel at any point.}
\item{Get help from Cynthia, Lillian or Alan if possible. If uncomfortable, freeze samples.}
\item{Remove clip from gel with special tool. If tool is not available, be very careful.}
\item{After the gel and it's associated apparatus and buffers have been situated, rinse each well with 15 uL of .5X TBE buffer.}

NOTE: Ensure that the loading dye has Bromophenol Blue in it.
\item{Add 8\uL of samples A, B, D, C and X with 1.5\uL{} of loading dye for a total volume of 8\uL to gel respectively, left to right with the wells at the top.}
\item{Add 10\uL{} of Loading Dye to the well twice to the right of X (the seventh well from the left).}
\item{Add an appropriate amount of ladder (annotate the amount added on this sheet) the the far right well (wells at the top).}
\item{Add a 50/50 combination of sample \textbf{B} and sample \textbf{C} to the sixth well. That is, add \textbf{3\uL{}} of sample \textbf{B}, \textbf{3\uL{}} of sample \textbf{B} and \textbf{1.2}\uL{} of loading dye to the sixth well, from the left with the wells at the top.}

\end{wrapfigure}
This "gel" is a digital combination of multiple exposure lengths. The gels were combined to increase the visibility of our "samples". The gels are pictured unedited below in Figures \ref{gels3} \& \ref{gels2}.

From left to right, we \textit{should} have a ThermoFisher 10bp  Ladder, samples A, B, D, C and X. The lane to the right X had 5\uL{} of loading dye in it. However, judging from the results, this is \textbf{not} an accurate description of the actual contents of the gel. Before we discuss our hypothesis for what went wrong, let us address what ideally \textit{should} have happened.

In lane 1 (numbering left to right) we should have seen a ladder resembling the ladder to the right in Figure \ref{Ideal Ladder}. Figure \ref{Ideal Ladder} depicts the same 10bp ladder from ThermoFisher on and identical gel. Moreover, it was run via the same protocol as our "Perfect Page III" that this procedure's gel based analysis section was modeled after. The main differences between this procedure and that of Perfect Page III (other than the DNA being analyzed) is the amount of ladder added. In this procedure, we added 1\uL{} of stock while in Perfect Page III only 0.5\uL{} was added. This was done because the 0.5\uL{} added in the initial agarose based \BdATP{} Incorporation Detection resulted in a ladder that was too weak after 40 minutes of staining. Our concentrations of DNA were between the second and third dilutions of Perfect Page III, both of which appeared satisfactorily. As such, \textit{given that there was no human error} the result above should not have resulted.\\

In row A, we should have seen a smear characteristic of a standard \tdt{} extension. Whether or not this smear is present isn't clear from the images collected.\\ 

In row B, we should have seen a 6bp oligo due to the addition of a \BdATP{} to our initial 5bp primer. These predicted results are not visually present in the images we collected. Nor, however, is the smear characteristic of a standard \tdt{} extension that would have appeared had there been an issue with the performance of the \BdATP{}.\\

In row D we should have 6bp oligo due to the addition of a dideoxyadenosine triphosphate to our initial 5bp primer (similar to row C). These predicted results are not visually present in the images we collected. Nor, however, is the smear characteristic of a standard \tdt{} extension that would have appeared had there been an issue with the performance of the dideoxyadenosine triphosphate.\\

In row C, we should have seen a smear characteristic of a standard \tdt{} extension. Whether or not this smear is present isn't immediately clear from the images we collected, but there does seem to be some smearing (see Figure \ref{Hybrid Gel}).

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.25\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=1in]{smiling.png}
\caption{Upside-down Smile on SDS-PAGE Gel{\small (via ResearchGate)}}
\label{Upside-down Smile}
\end{wrapfigure}

In row X, we should have seen a 5bp oligo. This was the only reagent present in the sample. Again, this is not visually present in the images we collected.\\

We also should have seen an even travel of the samples. We did not. What we did see was a "upside down smile" like depicted in Figure \ref{Upside-down Smile}. This is likely due to (1) too much current (and by relation, too much voltage) (which was never noticed in Perfect Page I, Perfect Page II, or Perfect Page III) or (2) the gel was not pressed securely against the gaskets which allowed buffer to leak out\cite{smileSDS}. It seems that the gel was not pressed securely against the gaskets, as we did not see similar behavior in Perfect Page I, Perfect Page II, or Perfect Page III. 

The question remains: why is there ladder in the rows, A, B and D? And why does the intensity of the ladder decrease as the rows get farther and father away from the ladder row? I propose a two fold explanation: First, the ladder was prepared at too high of a concentration. This prediction rests on the fact that the ladder is much \textit{much} brighter when imaged than we expected. Secondly, when the ladder was pipetted into row 1, a small amount of ladder was present on the \textit{outside} of the pipette tip. When the tip entered the buffer, it fell from the tip into wells A, B and D. Moreover, the motion of the tip from left to right would have created a fluid motion conducive to more DNA ending up in the well of A rather than the well of D. Given that the ladder was sufficiently over concentrated, a single \uL{} present on the tip would be more than enough to result in a gel like Figure \ref{Hybrid Gel}. This could have been prevented by (1) preparing the ladder correctly and (2) being \textit{extra} careful when pipetting samples into the SDS-PAGE gel. This is the most convincing hypothesis of error yet. It also implied that our sample is in the gel, we just can't see it. It also means that \textit{no scientifically sound conclusions} regarding \BdATP{} and it's efficiency of incorporation can be made from the images collected in this experiment.

\subsection{Procedure Notes}
None not already addressed. In summary, we should be more careful when pipetting samples into gels and we need to ensure that the buffer levels on our SDS-PAGE gels is sufficiently high.
