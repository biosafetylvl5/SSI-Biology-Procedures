\section{Procedure Purpose} % CHANGE THIS
Determine if the the modified nucleotide, \BdATP{}, can be noticeably incorporated by \tdt{} in "standard conditions" while determining the blocking efficacy \& purity of our \BdATP{} stock.

\section{Overview} % CHANGE THIS 
This lab will attempt to append \BdATP{} to a \textbf{very short (5bp) primer}. The effectiveness of this attempt will be determined by attempting to form a homopolymer on the modified primer. If a homopolymer is formed, the blocking groups did not effectively prevent their formation. This could be due to many reasons (the most likely of which being that the blocking groups either (1) were appended without the 2' nitrobenzyl due to sample degradation or (2) were not appended). If the homopolymer was not formed (but a homopolymer was formed on the controls) it follows that the blocking groups prevented the formation of the homopolymer, likely due to them preforming their intended function. Moreover, all samples will be run on a PAGE gel in order to achieve single nucleotide resolution. This will allow us to confirm that the \BdATP{} is the only base appended to the "blocked" sample. A ddATP control will help as well.

\subsection{Analysis}



\subsubsection{Prepare Gel}
\item{Prepare a 15\% Denaturing Urea-PAGE gel. Rinse each well with 15 uL of .5X TBE buffer. Allow to pre-run at 200V for 20 minutes prior to continuing.}

\subsubsection{Run Gel}
NOTE: Ensure that the loading dye has Bromophenol Blue in it.
\item{Add 8\uL of samples A, B, D, C and X with 1.5\uL{} of loading dye for a total volume of 8\uL to gel respectively, left to right with the wells at the top.}
\item{Add 10\uL{} of Loading Dye to the well twice to the right of X (the seventh well from the left).}
\item{Add an appropriate amount of ladder (annotate the amount added on this sheet) the the far right well (wells at the top).}
\item{Add a 50/50 combination of sample \textbf{B} and sample \textbf{C} to the sixth well. That is, add \textbf{3\uL{}} of sample \textbf{B}, \textbf{3\uL{}} of sample \textbf{B} and \textbf{1.2}\uL{} of loading dye to the sixth well, from the left with the wells at the top.}
\item{Run at 200V}
\item{Remove gel once the Bromophenol Blue has almost reached the $\frac{3}{4}$ point \cite{dnaAgarose}}

\subsubsection{Stain \& View Gel}
\item{While the gel runs, prepare 1X SYBR Gold Staining Solution with TBE as dilute}
\item{Once gel has finished running, \textbf{\textit{lightly}} agitate gel while submerged in solution for 40 minutes.}
\item{Review gel with gel viewer. Until unnecessary, place gel back in stain for 20 minute increments and re-image.}
\item{Post pictures to Slack.}\\

\subsection{Summary}

\subsection{Gel Analysis}

\gel{./gels/blocked-annotated.png}{Overlay of two gels, the overnight stain and the 35minute overexposed stain}{Hybrid Gel}{This "gel" is a digital combination of the overnight and 35 minute stain. The gels were combined to reduce diffusion while increasing the visibility of our samples. The unmodified gels are pictured below in figure \ref{gels}. 


In the gel, from left to right, we have sample A (extended control with Adenine homopolymer to test geometric interactions), sample B (the "blocked" sample incubated with the 2'-nitrobenzyl modified adenine), sample C (a standard dNTP extended polymer formed in the second incubation) and sample X (just our 25bp primer) and a 50/50 mix of sample B and sample C. We also have a 10bp ladder from Thermo Fisher in the far right well \cite{10bpladder}.


Notably, sample B (marked with a dashed box) did not undergo marked extension after being incubated with \BdATP{}. There is some indication of slight extension (predicted due to \BdATP{} degradation). Moreover, the difference between sample A, sample B \textit{and} sample C further supports the conclusion that \BdATP{} was effectively incorporated by \tdt{} in standard conditions \textit{and} that \BdATP{} effectively prevents further incorporation of nucleotides.


However, given that there is only one sample (by the nature of this experiment) that exhibits this behavior, many other factor could have caused this behavior. Most notably, a human error that resulted in the omission of \tdt{} buffer, dATP, \tdt{} or nuclease free water would have produced visibly similar results. The fact that samples A and C both underwent successful extensions likely reduces (but does not eliminate) the apparent probability that human error is the source of the apparently promising results. Follow up experiments are necessary for confirmation and characterization.}

\caption{From left to right on the top row, we have 15, 25 and 35 minutes of stain with SYBR Gold all exposed for faint bands. On the bottom from left to right, we have a 2 second exposure of the gel after 35 minutes of stain, a faint bands exposure at 45 minutes of stain and finally a faint bands exposure of the gel after it was stained overnight. All staining was preformed with SYBR Gold.}

\subsection{Procedure Notes}
A 4\% gel was used, where a 2\% gel would have done just as fine. Further, the initial stain should have been 40 minutes, not 15.
